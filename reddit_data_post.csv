"The important question is, do you know who you will marry ?
If ur marrying the right person then it really doesnt matter when"
"Getting married and having children while young pays off when you are retired. I was married at 20 and had two children by 30. Now retired in my 60s, my children are financially secure, and I still have the energy to enjoy grandchildren and a stable retirement. In other words, it's beneficial not to keep paying for your children after you are retired!

I'm not gonna lie:  it is extremely difficult to adapt to a life partner and raise kids while you are still developing into a full adult. But I have learned that being with a life partner increases my overall capabilities in life and gives me a built-in accountability that serves me to be a better human. 

You sound ready to move up another level in life. To decide, ask yourself this:  Does s/he make me a better human? If yes, then you have your answer."
"Your age is absolutely fine. I just don’t get what your friends and family mean by ‘3ich 7yatek’ as if being married means you stop living. That’s such a backwards mentality. The way marriage is viewed in Morocco is seriously outdated. People act like it’s the end of freedom: you stay home all day, cook, eat, and make babies while your husband grows a belly and your wife gets fat. It’s depressing.. and frankly, disgusting.
We’re in 2025. If you’re financially stable and emotionally ready, then you're already ahead. But don’t rush into it. Marriage should be a partnership that adds value to your life, not more responsibility, frustration, or dead weight.
Most people are afraid of marriage because they’ve seen it done wrong, and here in Morocco, people tend to mess it up completely. Their thinking is so shallow and superficial, they choose partners based on all the wrong things and end up miserable. Then they blame marriage, when the real issue is that they picked poorly. Choose smart, or don’t choose at all."
"Wa alaikom salam bro,
I’m 40 yo, not married yet I was experiencing the same thing as you. What’s called 3ich 7yatek is just an illusion, the problem is that you will be used to that life of 3ich 7yatek that you will not think about marriage until you are 38 or 40.

Go for it, twekel 3la Allah."
"Twekel 3la lah, gher khtar mezyan hada chart 👍"
"If you are ready mentally and financially then go ahead and get married. It's your life man, not theirs"
"Well in my opinion, you should first seriously think about it and set up how do u envision mariage in general and your lifestyle in particular ? how many kids u wish to have ? How do u want to raise them? How are the finance will be managed? Your role as the husband and father (if u wish to have kids).

Think about your values and your deal breakers and things you would appreciate if your partner shared.

Set up standards for yourself and for your partner.

Be informed and read book or check podcasts about marriage and how to build a strong and healthy mariage and how to raise kids well and how to manage conflicts. There are many arabic podcasts made by specialists , psychologist, couple counselors etc

I think for getting married at 24 is fine especially if your ready and mature.

Good luck to u"
"if you think you're ready , go ahead champ ! it's your life not theirs.

ghir howa you gotta find the right partner."
If shes the right one then why not
"Get married early and ""live your life"" with your spouse. 


Having kids early is also a good idea because you won't be old when they are old enough to take care of themselves. Get legal counseling about the financial side of marriage since it's probably the biggest contract of your life you'll ever sign.


Edit: it didn't work out for me but the reasons are not related to age or maturity"
"Hmm I mean you’re clearly doing very well for your age, so there isn’t really a legitimate issue with getting married. However I also understand where your family and friends are coming from as well. You should live your life a bit and gain new experiences before committing to someone for quite literally the rest of your life. Even if you spend time on yourself for like 4 years you’ll only be 28 which is still young and an ideal age to get married. Don’t rush it: live your life a bit, and maybe you’ll come across the right person in the process."
"Just get married man.
Going against your entourage opinion will actually signal you're ready. 
All the best"
"you have everything any young man can ask for, Twekel 3la lah"
"I got married at 24. Worked really well for me.

It's never too soon nor too late; it's about finding the right person."

"That's a big step. Just remember, marriage is a big responsibility. It's not just about love. You need to be financially ready, or at least stable enough to take care of a family. And most importantly, you need a lot of patience. Marriage isn't always easy. There will be challenges, and patience is what gets you through them.

You're still young. You still have time. Take your time to choose the right person, not someone perfect, because no one is. but someone who understands you and supports you. Your partner can either help your life move forward or drag it down. So choose wisely, because who you marry can shape your entire future.

Also, make sure you speak to your girlfriend seriously and openly. Ask her if she’s truly ready for marriage. Set clear expectations and boundaries before getting married. It’s important to have open, honest conversations. You both need to be on the same page about your future together.

And through all of this, d3i w twkl 3la lah, and let things happen at the right time."
"It's not that deep , you can try and see if they're right or wrong. Just don't get kids , as long as there are no kids you're safe"
"Do it when you feel ready. “Ready” isn’t the same for everyone, and no one is going to live your life for you. If you ever regret it, those regrets will be yours, you’re free, so enjoy it.

Also, people are rarely happy with their situation: married people envy singles, and single people crave having someone. Be careful who you listen to, it could be subjective."
"I think knowing why you want to get married will help you decide. 
Some people get married because they want kids, others want a ""halal partner "", the list goes on.
Read some books about it and watch some podcasts. Alot of people think it's easy , and it is only of you worked on yourself,  processed your childhood truama, and healed yourself .
It's a responsibility. 
and btw it's not always age it's mostly maturity in every aspect: emotionally,  mentally,  intellectually. 
Good luck👍"
"""N3ich hyati"" 
God this rubs me the wrong way. So men are told that once they marry their life is done for, and what i (a woman) hear is that my life will really begin once i am married... what the fuck? 

Anyway OP this isnt directed to you cause its your family that says that. I will tell you to do whatever the fuck you want. Forget about expectations and do what YOU want. I would simply tell you not to rush mariage with any person. Take the time to get to know them, doesnt matter if it takes a couple of years"
You're not ready if you have to ask

I think that two questions that I try to ask myself before considering a potential partner (I know they might seem weird but read till the end)

Would you be fine having her as a mother ? (Is she fit to be a mom)

Would you be fine having her as a daughter ? (How will she raise ur daughter)

This is the very humble (maybe foolish) opinion of a 24 yo software engineer (so take my comment with a pinch of salt)

Best of luck to you."
Actually that would be the perfect age to settle down but the problem is in finding the right individual because getting married to the wrong person may end up fucking u up as person and ruining a massive portion of ur life
"go for it, twekel 3la Allah"
"If u find the right person, marry him it’s not about age  if u feel ready emotionally and financially just go for it marrying young can be a great way to avoid haram Allah yssser lik"
If you're ready for marriage then go for it and my honest opinion is that if you're stable financially marrying young is the best thing someone can do and it keeps you away from falling into something haram and since you're thinking of it seriously توكل على الله and everything will be good inchallah
What does your girlfriend think about this ? Is she ready ? I feel like you’re asking the wrong people
"""T3ich hyatk"" is just a tberad ela rass for traumatised kids or attention seekers.

"if you find the right person you'll ""t3ich 7yatk"" even better"
"Bro I'm 22m and I'm thinking the exact same way( and I'm also software engineer lol) I think go for it, just make sure to choose to not choose the wrong person and take your time there is no need to rush you're obviously still young and have time"
Start meeting up with potential partners u gotta make profit of the fact you are still young you got no pressure yet so use this time to get to know what do you want in a partner etc
"Do what you do best, twekel ala allah, just don't have kids, they will ruin all the fun for you and your wife. It's good to see individuals my age think about marriage tbh, it restores my faith a bit, best of luck."
"If you believe you're a good man who'll treat his wife with kindness and be a supportive partner, then trust in God and take the leap. Marriage won't steal your happiness or freedom; instead, God will bless you with a wonderful companion, and you'll share joyful moments together. Moreover, it will also keep you from falling into forbidden actions. Focus on finding the right person, and I wish you God's guidance and success.

"Marriage at 24 isn't that early, it's about at the sweet spot.  
People confuse marriage with ""having children"", because one you can opt out of easily with little to no consequences, and the other not so much.  
If you have someone in mind whom you're interested in, take it slow, you're still young. Talk to them, meet them regularly, see if they share the same values/principles as you, and when you feel ready, propose and marry them, and see how it works for the first 1-3 years after getting married. Then you can decide on whether you wanna have kids or not.  
The main issue on why your relatives think you're a bit too young to get married, is because they associate marriage with having kids. And as a 24 that might indeed be the case, but not for marriage."

Your age is absolutely fine! Go for it!
"24 is the kind of age where you develop most of your personality, and finish your transition to adulthood, so no it's not too early.

I would say too early is around 20"
"Salam a khouya,

I really admire the fact that you’re reflecting deeply instead of just following pressure from either side. Marriage isn’t about age—it’s about intention, readiness, and clarity. If you feel emotionally and mentally prepared, and you’re not doing it just to check a box or avoid loneliness, then 24 isn’t “too young” at all.

A few things to consider before committing:
	1.	Emotional maturity — can you handle conflict with patience and empathy?
	2.	Shared vision — do you and your potential spouse align on values, goals, lifestyle, parenting (if that’s in the picture)?
	3.	Growth mindset — you’re both going to change over the years. Choose someone who’s ready to grow with you, not someone who expects you to stay the same.
	4.	Independence vs. interdependence — have you built a life you enjoy alone, so that marriage becomes a bonus, not a rescue?

Ignore the “n3ich 7yati first” hype if it doesn’t resonate with you. “Living life” isn’t about clubbing, travel, or freedom from responsibility. Sometimes it’s building a peaceful, meaningful life with the right person beside you.

If you’ve met her and you both feel aligned, twekel 3la Allah. And if not, keep preparing yourself until the time—and person—is right.

Wishing you clarity and baraka."
"If this is how you’ve thought about your future, why are you then asking social media what you should do? Ultimately it’s your life sounds like you really need to learn a lot more about life. Discussing your person status at work resulting in your coworkers giving relationship advise to you resulting in contemplating marital future. Ask yourself what marriage means to you. I live in the US so our incomes are completely different. At 24, living in an apartment working entry level in a job isn’t ready for marriage. 32 with a decade of experience, a house, car, no debt six figures income, with savings is ready for marriage. That builds a foundation and a partnership with a spouse you equally care about are able to support. What’s hers is hers and what’s yours is hers. It’s the Moroccan way!"
Having you’re own apartment does not mean you should get married khoya. You get married when you’re in a relationship and it’s going somewhere and both of you are emotionally ready to be together forever. Marriage is a huge commitment man.

better work on making a lot of money coz marriage is costly, women are not bad but they're too demanding these days, it's just a fact of today!

However what i believe nobody actually succeeds in communicating and what your parents/friends mean with ( live your life ), being with a women committed to her means not just providing that’s basic but also means giving huge part of your brain and soul dedicated to her women are emotionally demanding more than you think no girl u would ever meet will convey this she herself doesn’t know till shes doing it to you after marriage.

And here where the living your life part comes to play yes you have money but you don’t have mental capacity to live life you, problems will follow and this is only with no kids with kids problems is what you are waiting for.

So put urself in this situation, now you can have breaks and isolate when you want be afraid and be even weak when you have to, to go through life we are humans not robots.

Well in marriage my friend you just can’t do that, you have to be ready 24/7 with kids you need to be ready and alert even more.

There is no personal space anymore no man cave no time to relax you just can’t you literally provide and manage others life let that sink in.


Yes we are afraid of being alone and it’s natural our brains knows we will die so it tricks us to do this get a partner to have babes.

At least Wait till ur brain is fully developed after 25 revisit this marriage idea at 26 at least and trust me your world view will change and honestly 2 years won’t make a difference in marriage but it will in ur future."
"عَنْ عَبْدِاللَّهِ بْنِ مَسْعُودٍ: قَالَ لَنَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ: **يَا مَعْشَرَ الشَّبَابِ، مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمُ الْبَاءَةَ فَلْيَتَزَوَّجْ، فَإِنَّهُ أَغَضُّ لِلْبَصَرِ، وَأَحْصَنُ لِلْفَرْجِ، وَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَيْهِ بِالصَّوْمِ؛ فَإِنَّهُ لَهُ وِجَاءٌ**.

يقول أيضا النبي ﷺ في الحديث الصحيح: **تنكح المرأة لأربع: لمالها، ولجمالها، ولحسبها، ولدينها؛ فاظفر بذات الدين تربت يداك.**"
This is a decision that only you should make. Sit with yourself and know all of your goals short and long term and decide for yourself.
"are you ready in a a different things not only money and u have apartment, are you ready psychologically are you ready to take responsibility and more and more, u already know this i guess and marrying while young is better really and the most important question and thing you should do is find the الزوجه الصالحة, so twakel 3la allah and pray he gives you the right and the good spouse really. and about the “3ich 7yatek”. الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم said الدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ وَخَيْرُ مَتَاعِ الدُّنْيَا الْمَرْأَةُ الصَّالِحَةُ so you will live your life happy with the right woman inshaallah. also in this time there is a lot of فتن. so i highly recommend everyone not only you to marry, even myself i want to marry soon inshaallah."
"Do it, just make very, very sure it's with the right person. Don't get married just to be married"
"Wtf does 3ich 7yatk even means (tmchi tsker?tzni?) 39lya d lkhra 3ndna f had l mojtama3 ay haja njibouha mn 3nd l gherb, if you have the financial and physical and mental capacity to handle marriage sir tzwej and fuck anyone who says otherwise, bnadem f 3mrna ch7al hadi db rah 3ndo 3 d lwlad w 6na db ka yt3amlo m3ana b7al l brahech, 24 rak machi sghir rak rajel, and any day you spend without marriage is wasted."
"The issue is not marriage in itself, but it is finding a woman who's right for you, you ll lose a lot if you pick wrong, but one of the advantages of marrying young is that you ll have enough energy for the babies and they ll grow fast and get out of your hair faster. Relationships are complicated."
"3ish 7yatek , mazal bezaf d lhwaij t9der t3lmhom f wahed 5 snin de plus"
"It’s not about being ready, It’s about finding your person, if It’s the case, go for It.

Just keep in mind that choosing your partner is one of the biggest decisions ever in your life."
"Bro they are right marrying at 24 is like leaving a party that started at 6pm by 6:30pm.

Work on yourself first I am 26yo, also a software engineer and I can’t think about marriage until my 40s and when I will marry I will do it by my terms, you must be ambitious and explore new adventures, develop your skills, further your path in corporate world, travel and live your life, marriage will bring you nothing but the bills, lack of money, more responsibility and maybe a 1st divorce.

Maybe you may see other opportunities by leaving abroad 2 years from now, don’t be hasty, I know a lot of my friends who regretted marrying at young age and they feel now wasting their lives and potentials.

The people who think about marriage in young age are the ones who are failures and want to consider marriage as achievement.

I guess from your post also that you have never had relationship with a girl before, right ?"
