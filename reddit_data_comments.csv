As I dip my finger into a tub of frosting lol
That‚Äôs so awesome! My late father lost his wedding ring and he was distraught. He lost it while on vacation and my mom called and tried to find it for months. 2 years later we were on a flight headed to a family reunion and my dad was digging around and looking for something in his backpack and his ring literally just flew out of the bag and landed in his hand. He yelped and got very excited and he kept saying did you see that?!? I was laughing too because it was kind of astonishing. My mom was in the restroom when it happened so when she came back she was like what in the world is going on. It‚Äôs a nice happy moment to look back and I‚Äôm so happy for you as well.
It's nice to see you are still posting. Keep it up. Seems like it's helped you.

"Good for you. Cutting off a friend is one of the hardest things to do, but if their toxic behavior causes so much pain for you, it's necessary to protect your peace, even if it hurts at first. You deserve healthy, respectful relationships, and sometimes walking away is the most loving thing you can do for yourself."

"This is stunning, and quite romantic. I hope she says yes forever!"
"That's so beautiful and sweet. I'm sure she'll be thrilled. Don't worry about the price, it won't matter to the right person and the money for an expensive ring could be used for important things. It could be the down payment on a home, car, pay off debt, etc. and really help you two start your future. Much better than an expensive shiny rock."

i did hah... unwooshing ur woosh
This is an underrated obstacle many people face. I'm so happy you successfully exited this abusive relationship! Great job!
"Hey, dollar value doesn't mean anything. She'll love the ring, and I wish you both luck. And, hell, if you ever decide you do want to ""upgrade"" her ring, then go with Moisanite. Still cheaper than diamond, but much prettier.

I think she'll still love the combined birth stones ring the most though."
THIS IS SO DARN PRETTY. All the best!!! Haply for you both. <33
"I think a mullet looks pretty cute, he could totally pull it off!"
Ok well I hope everything goes smoothly!
"She better! Or else! /s
I'll love her even if she says no"

We will be *next to* the water."
"Thank you , I can see my future with her it's so amazing."
Yeah true!
"She totally will.
I'm so excited and its so hard to keep a secret. 
Thanks for letting me share it here."
"Thank you! I agree on the dollar value, and she does too."
It does! Thank you
Thank you. Yes it is!
"I absolutely love this! There is something about being in the nice sun and being outside, and being near water‚Ä¶ and after all that  being cozy and cuddled in. It  is completely relaxing and refreshing and rejuvenating .

Congratulations. How did you get the finger size for the ring?
My daughter would react just like this with her dad üíï
"I thought it was just me.  I wear my mom's rings to special occasions so she ""can be there"".  I couldn't imagine if I lost one of them, I would also be devastated! 

My parents were divorced and when I was a teenager my Mom started dating a new guy who she seemed to care for very much.  He came around often and was obviously smitten with my Mom.  One night he proposed with a beautiful 14 marquis diamond ring, he wanted to marry her and move away as he was offered a new job in another state.  My younger sister was still in school and my Mom didn't want to uproot her.  She declined the offer but he told her to keep the ring in case she changed her mind.  She didn't.  But soon afterward, she lost it.  We looked everywhere, we tore her room apart and I spent hours on my hands and knees searching for it. She thought she sucked it up in the vacuum and it was lost forever.

20 years later, cleaning out her room to move, we found the ring under my Mom's platform bed.  10 years later she gave it to me because she didn't want anyone else to claim it when she passed.  She remembered the many hours I spent helping her look for it.  That's one of the rings I wear in her memory.  I keep it in a very special box so it never gets lost again.  

I'm so glad you found your Mom's ring!"
he is so cuuute!ü•π

"Today is my 32 wedding anniversary, married to me best friend who I have known since 8th grade. I think the ring is precious and as long as she prefers white metal I am sure she will love it. Best of luck to you both."
I love this! You‚Äôre very talented.
"Hell yes!! La familia de mi novio es Venezolana! As√≠ que estoy aprendiendo espa√±ol :) great job, self introspection/reflection is hard work but so worth it in the long run!! You‚Äôre doing awesome!"
Congratulations and im so excited for yall to start this beautiful new journey. Don't ever worry about where or how much the ring cost. My first ring was from Walmart and I honestly love it so so much. He did what you want and upgraded a few years later but I was like why the first one is more perfect than anything! She will love you no matter what!
